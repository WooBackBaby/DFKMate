# DFKMate - DeFi Kingdoms Quest Helper ðŸŽ‰
  >  The bot needs your private key to complete quests on your behalf.

  DFKMate starts and completes quests of all your heroes once their stamina is full.
  
  You need at least 2 ONE tokens in your wallet and at least 1 hero.
  
  > Stamina recharges at a rate of 1 unit every 20 minutes. A full recharge takes 500 minutes, or ~8 hours.
  
  Deploy bot to a remote server to have it running 24/7. I recommend using Heroku since it's free and easy to setup.

## Risk
The main risk for users is that the bot has access to your wallet. You're highly encouraged to read the code yourself, even if you're not a programmer. There's comments to explain what it does step by step.
