# DFKMate - DeFi Kingdoms Quest Helper ðŸŽ‰
## Risk
>  The bot needs your private key to complete quests on your behalf. The main risk for users is that the bot has access to your wallet, so you should check the code before using it! There's comments to explain what it does step by step. (in index.js)

  DFKMate starts and completes quests of all your heroes once their stamina is full.
  
  You need at least 2 ONE tokens in your wallet and at least 1 hero.
  
  > Stamina recharges at a rate of 1 unit every 20 minutes. A full recharge takes 500 minutes, or ~8 hours.
  
  Deploy bot to a remote server to have it running 24/7. I recommend using Heroku since it's free and easy to setup.
